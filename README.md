• The research question is how can we recommend the best salary (totalpay or schoolpay – your
choice) for our next head football coach?
• Start with the data Coaches –https://github.com/2SUBDA/IST_718
• Review the data – clean as appropriate
• Consider the base worksheet and additional data such as:
o Stadium size – available via internet search
o Graduation rate :
Available from https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/26801/summary
or
From here https://web3.ncaa.org/aprsearch/gsrsearch
Use the most recent cohort available and include both GSR and FGR
o Annual donations to program – if available via internet search
o School’s win/loss record from last available year
o Other data as you determine might be applicable
• Build a data frame for your analysis
• Conduct an initial data analysis – exploratory data analysis – develop appropriate visualizations
• Fit a regression model with the salary as the response and the relevant predictors (i.e., you will
need more than one predictor)
• Answer the following questions in your report:
o What is the recommended salary for the Syracuse football coach?
o What would his salary be if we were still in the Big East? What if we went to the Big
Ten?
